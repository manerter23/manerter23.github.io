					<h1>WELCOME TO MY BLOG</h1>
					<h2>Day and Night of SEAIDITE</h2>
					<p><span>This event was held on October 18,2019 at Saint Louis University Tuguegarao City.
					</span><br>
					<span>This event happens every year and the participant is student from different course that have something to do in this organization.
					</span><br>
					<span>I was so excited in this event that i have been up all night until 2am in the morning and the attendance of this event is 6:00am to 7:00am but unfortunately my useless alarm didn’t woke me up so I ended up at 	9:00.
					</span><br>
					<span>When I'm on my way going to school I accidentally saw my professors then I heard one of them saying that my plus points for attending Day and Night will be half score because i was late and there is no valid reason for being late, but then this is not enough to ruin my day cause I've been waiting for my event and that is PATINTERO.
					</span><br>
					<span>I was so excited that I waited for that event until afternoon staying in one place, luckily I saw my supporters and classmate and together we wait for my event.
					</span><br>
					<span>But suddenly one of officers in that event told us that my event was cancel due to problem of that the judges of my event didn’t lunch and so the event was canceled.
					I was so upset that I event went home and instead of going home, I went to computer shop for my stress reliever and I play until it night.
					</span><br>
					<span>And that’s how successfully ended our day and night event
